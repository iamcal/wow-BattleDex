# BattleDex - Keep track of wild pet battles

This very simple addon tracks all of your wild pet battles.

It then adds text to wild pet tooltips, telling you how many of each quality of 
that pet you've battled and what pets it's been seen with as a secondary.

I built this addon so that I could say definitively that I've battled a thousand
Thundertail Flappers without ever seeing a rare.
